# 📘 DSA Challenge – Striver’s A2Z Playlist

Welcome to my **DSA Challenge** repository!
I am following **Striver’s A2Z DSA Playlist** step by step to strengthen my **Data Structures & Algorithms** skills, improve problem-solving ability, and prepare for coding interviews.

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Build a **strong foundation** in DSA (from basics to advanced).
* ✅ Solve **structured problems** from Striver’s A2Z Playlist.
* ✅ Develop **consistency** with daily practice.
* ✅ Prepare for **FAANG-level & top product-based company interviews**.

## 🗂️ Playlist Structure

The playlist is divided into **steps** that gradually cover everything:

1. **Basics & Introduction**
2. **Sorting & Arrays**
3. **Binary Search & Recursion**
4. **Hashing & Strings**
5. **Linked List & Stack/Queue**
6. **Binary Trees & BST**
7. **Recursion & Backtracking**
8. **Greedy, DP, Graphs**
9. **Tries, Bit Manipulation, Advanced Topics**

## 🚀 How I Work

* 🔹 **Consistency over quantity** → At least X problems per day.
* 🔹 **Quality practice** → Focus on patterns, not random problems.
* 🔹 **Revision** → Maintain notes & revisit weak topics.
* 🔹 **Mock Interviews** → After playlist completion.

⚡ **Consistency > Motivation.**
This repo is my **DSA growth journal** – from basics to mastery. 🚀
